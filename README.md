# Advanced Threat Detection and Response Automation

A comprehensive threat detection and response system designed to monitor network and host-based environments, automate responses, and identify vulnerabilities using MITRE ATT&CK, SOAR platforms, and Ansible.

## 📌 Project Goal
Develop a Python-based threat detection system integrated with SIEM tools, with automated response capabilities.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Threat Modeling**: Mapped TTPs with MITRE ATT&CK to identify critical vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Response**: Created Ansible workflows, reducing response times by 40%.
- **Custom SOAR Pipelines**: Built detection pipelines to automate threat response and minimize manual intervention.
- **Web Security**: Used OWASP ZAP to secure APIs by addressing SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming & Scripting**: Python, Ansible
- **Platforms**: SIEM tools, SOAR platforms (with custom pipelines)
- **Security Tools**: OWASP ZAP, MITRE ATT&CK
