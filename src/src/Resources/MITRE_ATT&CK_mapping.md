***This guide outlines how to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for identifying and mitigating threats.***

# Mapping TTPs Using MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to model and understand cyber threats. This guide provides an overview of using MITRE ATT&CK to map threats and improve security responses.

## üéØ What is MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized framework that categorizes cyber adversary behavior. It‚Äôs commonly used for:
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify and anticipate attacker behavior.
- **Gap Analysis**: Assess current defenses against known TTPs.
- **Threat Hunting**: Guide searches for indicators of compromise (IOCs) across networks.

## üîç Key Components of MITRE ATT&CK

1. **Tactics**: The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind an adversary‚Äôs actions, such as gaining initial access or establishing persistence.
2. **Techniques**: The ‚Äúhow‚Äù attackers achieve their goals, like phishing for credentials or executing code.
3. **Procedures**: Specific implementations of techniques, often unique to particular threat groups.

## üìë Mapping TTPs for Threat Detection

1. **Identify Tactics Relevant to Your Environment**:
   - Examples: **Initial Access**, **Execution**, **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**.
   - Focus on tactics that are most relevant to your network or industry.

2. **Select Techniques to Address**:
   - Map each tactic to specific techniques.
   - For instance, under **Initial Access**, you might focus on **Phishing** or **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**.

3. **Define Detection Rules**:
   - Based on mapped techniques, create rules in SIEM tools to detect TTPs.
   - Example: For **Credential Dumping** (Privilege Escalation), monitor for suspicious access to credential stores.

## üõ† Example TTP Mapping for Threat Detection

| Tactic              | Technique                | Detection Approach                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Access      | Phishing                 | Monitor email traffic for suspicious attachments |
| Execution           | PowerShell               | Log and analyze PowerShell script executions     |
| Privilege Escalation| Credential Dumping       | Detect access to sensitive files (SAM, LSASS)    |
| Lateral Movement    | Remote Desktop Protocol  | Track RDP connections and flag unusual activity  |

## üöÄ Resources and Tools

- **ATT&CK Navigator**: A tool for visualizing and mapping TTPs. [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)
- **SIEM Integration**: Configure your SIEM tool to detect ATT&CK TTPs by creating custom detection rules.
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Use threat intel feeds that align with MITRE ATT&CK for real-time mapping.

## üìò Conclusion

Using MITRE ATT&CK helps in creating a structured approach to threat detection, mapping each stage of an attack, and refining defenses based on real-world adversary behavior. By adopting ATT&CK in your security processes, you can proactively mitigate threats before they escalate.
