# Usage Guide: Advanced Threat Detection and Response Automation

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. **Ansible** installed for running automated playbooks.
3. **tcpdump** (requires sudo) for network monitoring.
4. **OWASP ZAP** for API security testing.
5. **SOAR Platform** (optional but recommended) for full automation capabilities.

## ðŸ“¥ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Threat-Detection-and-Response-Automation.git
   cd Advanced-Threat-Detection-and-Response-Automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install required Python packages (if any are listed in `requirements.txt`).
   - Ensure Ansible and tcpdump are installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ansible tcpdump -y
     ```

3. **Configure Variables**
   - Open `src/ansible_playbook.yml` and set any required variables, such as `ip_to_block` or `suspicious_service`.

4. **Prepare SOAR Pipelines**
   - If using SOAR, configure your SOAR platform to import `pipeline1.yml` and `pipeline2.yml` located in the `custom_SOAR_pipelines/` directory.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

### 1. Start Threat Detection
Run the main Python script for threat detection:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 src/threat_detection.py
   ```

This script will:
- Monitor network traffic using `tcpdump`.
- Analyze system logs for suspicious activities.
- Track running processes for unauthorized applications.

Logs will be saved to `threat_detection.log`.

### 2. Deploy Automated Response Workflows
To automate response actions (e.g., IP blocking, account disabling), run the Ansible playbook:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook src/ansible_playbook.yml
   ```

This playbook:
- Blocks suspicious IPs detected by the system.
- Sends alerts to the security team for any triggered actions.
- Logs response actions to maintain a record of events.

### 3. Run API Security Scans with OWASP ZAP
1. Open OWASP ZAP and set the target API endpoint.
2. Perform a **Quick Scan** to identify vulnerabilities in API endpoints.
3. Review scan results and address any flagged vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

## ðŸ“Š Reviewing Results

- **Detection Logs**: Located in `threat_detection.log` for reviewing detected threats.
- **Response Logs**: Any actions taken by Ansible are recorded in `/var/log/response_log_<hostname>.txt`.
- **API Security Report**: Review the OWASP ZAP interface for a detailed breakdown of identified vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ§© Customization Tips

- **Modify SOAR Pipelines**: Update `pipeline1.yml` and `pipeline2.yml` to fit your organization's specific response workflows.
- **Add New Detection Rules**: Modify `threat_detection.py` to include additional detection patterns or integrate with a SIEM.
- **Expand API Scanning**: Customize OWASP ZAP settings to scan specific API endpoints with tailored payloads.
