# Project Overview: Advanced Threat Detection and Response Automation

## üìå Project Purpose
The **Advanced Threat Detection and Response Automation** project aims to enhance security monitoring, detection, and response capabilities within network and host-based environments. By integrating threat detection tools with automation platforms, this project enables faster and more effective responses to potential threats.

## üéØ Project Goals
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Continuously monitor network traffic, system logs, and processes to detect suspicious activities.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Leverage SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities to respond quickly to threats and minimize manual intervention.
- **Enhanced Vulnerability Identification**: Utilize threat modeling and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and identify critical vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive API Security**: Apply security testing techniques using OWASP ZAP to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in APIs.

## üåü Key Features
1. **Threat Detection System**: Python-based script integrated with SIEM tools to monitor network and host-based environments.
2. **Automated Response Workflows**: Uses Ansible playbooks and SOAR pipelines to automate IP blocking, account disabling, and alert notifications.
3. **Threat Modeling with MITRE ATT&CK**: Maps detected TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK, enabling targeted detection and proactive mitigation.
4. **API Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP scans APIs for vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and XSS, enhancing overall application security.

## üîç Use Cases
- **Security Analysts**: Helps analysts quickly detect and respond to threats in real-time.
- **Developers and Security Engineers**: Automates vulnerability discovery in APIs and secures application environments.
- **IT Operations Teams**: Streamlines incident response processes, reducing time to detect and contain threats.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools
- **Languages**: Python, YAML (Ansible playbooks and SOAR pipelines)
- **Security Tools**: Nuclei, OWASP ZAP, MITRE ATT&CK
- **Automation**: Ansible for playbooks, SOAR platforms for orchestration
- **Log Analysis**: SIEM integration, log monitoring for suspicious activities

## üìà Expected Outcomes
- **40% Reduction in Response Time**: Faster responses due to automated workflows and SOAR integrations.
- **Improved Detection Accuracy**: Enhanced detection of threats with TTP mapping and real-time monitoring.
- **Increased Security of APIs**: Comprehensive API scanning with OWASP ZAP to prevent data exposure and attacks.
